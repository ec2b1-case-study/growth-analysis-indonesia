Our research examines Indonesiaâ€™s **long-term economic development** by focusing on the roles of **capital accumulation**, **saving**, **population growth**, and **research and development**. Institutional and cultural factors, though potentially important, are not considered in this analysis to maintain a clear focus on these key economic drivers.

This notebook serves as the coding part of the project, aiming to answer key questions related to **Indonesia's economic development** using provided data. It includes:

1. **Trend Calculation**: Analyses the trends for the natural logarithms of real GDP and real GDP per capita at constant 2017 national prices, with robustness checks using levels instead of log levels.

2. **Total Factor Productivity (TFP) Measure**: Derives TFP using a production function, considering real GDP, the number of employed workers, and the capital stock, while testing robustness with alternative values for the production parameter alpha.

3. **Growth Accounting**: Breaks down the contributions of input variables to changes in GDP, focusing on long-run developments rather than yearly averages.

4. **Labour Productivity**: Constructs a series for GDP per worker to study labour productivity trends.
